        Dreamcatcher Custom Homes HomeBuilder Application is an indispensable tool for anyone seeking to build the home of their dreams at the right price.

        You may find that one of our dream home templates already has the layout and features that you desire. You can compare the templates side-by-side and customize each one until you have one that is just right. You can select, edit, and then save for later as many homes as you would like.

        If you would prefer to start from the beginning, we will guide you through every step of the way. To begin, give us an idea of your price range for the entire home, and then select one of the basic layouts from the list. The layouts can be filtered by layout type, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms to make searching easier. After looking at the details of each layout you will know the size and shape of the interior and exterior of your home, and you will be ready to fill it up with the perfect set of features.

        In order to help you find the set of features that will make you the happiest at a price you can afford, we need you to tell us what you think about the choices we have to offer. To start, we’ll ask you to rate how important each feature category is to you.  Most home builders like yourself have certain characteristics in mind that make a home feel like home.  You might call these the “essential” characteristics, whereas others may not be important at all, and still others fall somewhere in the middle. This information will help you with the tough decisions about what to include and what you will need to leave out in order to get the things you really want.

        After you’ve expressed your priorities, it is time for us to learn about your preferences for a variety of upgrades in each of those categories. As you read through the different options for a given feature, think about how much you would like to see each one of them in your finished home for the price that you see next to them. If you love them all, that’s great! Let us know by highly rating every single one. If there is one you strongly dislike, give it the lowest rating and we’ll make sure it is not considered as an option. If you already know exactly the one you want, check the “Must Have” box and we won’t bother with any of the other options for that category. Keep in mind that the more “Must Have’s” you pick, the more you might have to give up what you want in other categories. Also, keep an eye on your Budget Bar, which estimates how much you are preparing to spend based on the ratings you have filled in. There is also a spending chart to help you see how much progress you’ve made and how many features you still need to make decisions on. To help you with this, we’ll present the categories for you to rate approximately in order from most expensive to least expensive. Once we know about your likes and dislikes based on the choices and their prices, we’ll find the combination of choices that will make you the happiest for the budget you supplied at the beginning.

        Your results page displays a chart with 9 different possible homes represented by 9 nodes on a line graph. Each one uses the best combinarion of choices for each feature based on your ratings and with different maximum prices based on your budget (on the horizontal axis). Each home gets a score (on the vertical axis) that indicates how close it comes to meeting all of your highest rated upgrades across all the categories. The steepness of the lines slope between nodes reflects how much you more you’ll get if you spend a little more or how much you’ll have to give up if you spend a little less. You can click on a node to see exactly which option was selected for each feature. You can also change each of the selections individually by clicking edit while you’re looking at the home you want to modify. Once you have a home that you like, you can save it for later. Do this for as many homes as you want, and then click the Compare Saved Homes button to see all of your potential homes side-by-side.
